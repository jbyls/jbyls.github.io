Why am I here? Why are you here? Why do good questions come in threes? I've found it difficult in 2020 to do the level of self-reflection I typically do each new year. Maybe it's the fact that we're in the middle of an unprecedented global pandemic in which >83,000 Americans have died. Maybe it's the economic environment in which >30M Americans are recently out of work and my business will continue to feel the effects. Maybe it's our newborn girl that we welcomed just last month in the middle of all this chaos. 

I'm restarting this personal blog in the hopes of venting all kinds of frustrations I have from family life in quarantine, to transit and transportation issues around Boston and nationwide, to startup life, engineering and product development. Ultimately I'm hoping to use this as an outlet to turn thoughts into action and really put more passion into my work from managing a team of incredibly talented, multi-disciplinary engineers, to cycling advocacy and safe streets. Much of the content will be wonky and technical, some of it might be personal and revealing.
